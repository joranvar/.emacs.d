* Introduction

This document contains the settings for use of emacs. It is heavily
modeled after the literate org settings file by [[https://github.com/mfogleman/config][mfogleman]].

* General settings

** Personal information

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq user-full-name "Bart Post"
        user-mail-address "bart.post@gmail.com")
#+end_src

** Get the latest use-package and continue from there

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'package)
  (add-to-list 'package-archives
               '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)
  (setq load-prefer-newer t)
  (package-initialize)
  (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
    (package-refresh-contents)
    (package-install 'use-package))

  (require 'use-package)
#+END_SRC

* Interacting with the host operating system
** Which sound player to use?
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defvar joranvar/audio-player
    (or (executable-find "aplay") 
        (executable-find "afplay")
        "c:/Program Files/MPC-HC/mpc-hc64.exe")
    "The executable that makes sound.")
#+END_SRC
* Visual
* Productivity

I like to work with the pomodoro technique. The ticking sound reminds me of 
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package org-pomodoro
    :ensure t
    :init (setq org-pomodoro-play-ticking-sounds t
                org-pomodoro-audio-player joranvar/audio-player))
#+END_SRC
